# FILE:               python_pipeline/tools/validation/tests.yml
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This file defines all runnable JSNAPy validation tests. Each entry represents
#   a selectable item in the Validation Runner's UI.
#
# HOW TO USE:
#   To add a new validation test, create a new top-level entry. The key (e.g.,
#   'bgp_check') is the ID, and the 'title' and 'category' are used for display
#   in the UI. The Python script reads this file for the discovery process.
